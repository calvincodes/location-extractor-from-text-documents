<loc>SAN FRANCISCO</loc>  —   The virtual currency Bitcoin
has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy, pushing
 its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013. The
  price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest
  from places like Venezuela, where the local currency has
  lost much of its value, and India, where the government
  recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation.
  More broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged
  in American and European politics  —   highlighted by
  Donald J. Trump’s election victory  —   has given a new
  sheen to a currency that can move between countries with
  little oversight. “The more there is an expectation for
  new barriers to be erected, the more there is an
  expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money
   across borders,” said Gil Luria, the director of research
    at Wedbush Securities. Still, most of the people
    actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are
    coming from a single country: <loc>China</loc>. Some
    wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their
    government’s strict controls on moving money in and out
    of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in
    <loc>China</loc>. But the heavy trading on Chinese
    Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software,
    suggests that most of the price movement is a result of
    bets by speculators. In recent days, the price of a
    Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these
    exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges,
    suggesting more demand in <loc>China</loc> than outside
    . The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify. In dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1, 025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016. The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scar
