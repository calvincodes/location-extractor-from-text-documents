President Obama delivered a nostalgic but hopeful farewell address to the nation from a convention center in <loc>Chicago</loc>.

Show up. Dive in. Persevere. ” Here’s the full video and text. _____ 2. Senator Jeff Sessions of <loc>Alabama</loc>,   Donald J. Trump’s pick for attorney general, received a surprisingly gentle welcome at the start of his Senate confirmation hearing.

The whirlwind week of hearings continued with retired Gen. John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security nominee. Here’s the full schedule for the week. And late in the day came this news: The chiefs of America’s intelligence agencies last week gave Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama a summary of unsubstantiated reports that <loc>Russia</loc> had collected compromising and salacious personal information about Mr. Trump. The agencies are investigating, said two officials with knowledge of the matter. _____ 3. Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who expressed no remorse for killing nine people at a historically black church in <loc>Charleston</loc>, <loc>S. C</loc>. was sentenced to death.
