<loc>BEIJING</loc>  —   A few months after Lu Qiumei gave birth to her daughter in 2012, local officials visited her home and told her that she was required to be fitted with an intrauterine device. For more than three decades, this was national policy in <loc>China</loc>. The IUD was the government’s most important tool for limiting couples to one child, and almost all new mothers were required to get one.

And for many mothers, the offer has come too late for them to consider having a second child. “It’s the equivalent of someone injuring you and then mending the wound,” said Zhang Xintian, 25, who watched her mother go into surgery two years ago in the eastern province of <loc>Zhejiang</loc> to remove the IUD she had worn for more than two decades. In <loc>China</loc>, women often have the same IUD from soon after ch
