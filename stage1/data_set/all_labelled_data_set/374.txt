For Norwegians, the sight of dozens of American Marines traipsing through the snow in military fatigues  —   the first time foreign forces have been posted to their country’s territory since World War II  —   may have brought a welcomed sense of security, but it also harked back to a dark era of the Cold War that many had hoped to forget. A United States military plane on Monday delivered most of the 330 Marines to a garrison in Vaernes, in central <loc>Norway</loc>, a deployment that Norwegian officials said had been carried out by the United States as part of a bilateral agreement. It was the latest effort by the United States and its European allies to buttress their defenses against a resurgent Russia, which condemned the move. Despite being generally welcomed across the political spectrum, the arrival of the Marines from Camp Lejeune, <loc>N. C.</loc>  —   shown on Norwegian television dragging their suitcases through the snow  —   also provoked some jitters in <loc>Norway</loc>. A wealthy   country that is a member of NATO but not the European Union, the Nordic state has long prided itself on its independence. But the deployment recalled a Cold War era in which Russian intrigue grabbed headlines and Norwegians lived in fear of Soviet hegemony. Neuroses about Russia continue to exert influence in Norwegian popular culture. The political television thriller “Okkupert” depicts a future in which <loc>Norway</loc> is occupied by <loc>Russia</loc>, and with the backing of the European Union, takes over the country’s oil production. Such fears have been magnified in recent years with murky sightings of submarines across the region that have stoked concern about Russian espionage and military intervention. In October 2014, an unidentified vessel spotted off the Stockholm archipelago spurred Sweden’s largest mobilization since the Cold War and accusations that Russia was spying on the country.
