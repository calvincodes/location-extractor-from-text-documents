At first blush, there’s a baffling,   quality to Julian Assange’s latest star turn in our shambolic national story. He belongs in jail for “waging his war” against the <loc>United States</loc> by exposing its secrets, the conservative Fox News host Sean Hannity has said of him. An “  operative with blood on his hands,” Sarah Palin once called him.

(He’s currently living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in <loc>London</loc>, where he was granted asylum from Swedish authorities who are investigating a rape accusation against him that he says is false and politically motivated.) Yet even his toughest critics acknowle
