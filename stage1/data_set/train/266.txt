Eighteen women and girls have filed a federal lawsuit alleging that a Michigan doctor sexually assaulted them and that U. S. A. Gymnastics and other organizations that employed him failed to address their concerns and prevent further abuse, some of it dating back to the late 1990s. In the civil suit filed against Dr. Lawrence Nassar on Tuesday in Federal District Court in western Michigan, the plaintiffs are seeking relief for injuries related to sexual assault, nonconsensual touching, abuse and molestation. They say the abuse occurred while they were participating in gymnastics, swimming, figure skating, track and field, field hockey, basketball and soccer. Most of the plaintiffs were minors when the abuse occurred, according to the suit, which alleges that Dr. Nassar “sexually assaulted, abused and molested” the athletes, including by “digital vaginal and anal penetration. ” The lawsuit is the latest legal action against Dr. Nassar. In November, he was charged in Ingham County, Mich. with   sexual conduct with a person under 13, and in December, he was indicted in federal court in Grand Rapids, Mich. on child pornography charges. Matthew R. Newburg, Dr. Nassar’s lawyer in those state and federal criminal cases, said by email on Wednesday that his client has pleaded not guilty in those cases. “We are still receiving discovery and continue to review the reports as we receive them,” he said. Stephen Drew, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the new civil case, said on Wednesday that some of the 18 women had raised red flags as far back as 2000. The suit also names as defendants the places where he had worked or had treated athletes: U. S. A. Gymnastics, Michigan State University and Gedderts’ Twistars Gymnastics Club U. S. A. in Michigan. The plaintiffs said that Dr. Nassar had been recommended to them as a “renowned orthopedic sports medicine physician” while working at the university from about 1996 to 2016, and for the United States gymnastics team
