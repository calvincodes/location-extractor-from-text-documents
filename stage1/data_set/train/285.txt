The Season 7 “Real Housewives of <loc>New Jersey</loc>” reunion show took place in October in a theater in <loc>Westbury</loc>, <loc>N. Y.</loc> An elaborate    thing had been constructed on a stage that would soon seat the five Housewives, complete with a   rug and zebra chairs, everything sparkling, everything  . The set was erected so specifically and thoroughly that it included a kitchen in the back, unusable but complete, that you could see only a fraction of, and a fireplace that the cameras would never pick up. “That’s not a real fireplace?” I asked a production assistant, who answered, “It’s not not real. ” The five contracted Housewives arrived on <loc>Long Island</loc> the night before for this   reckoning of the season’s tensions, equal parts State of the State panel discussion and   of every lunchtime confrontation that occurred at my   high school. The Housewives were shuttled in black S. U. V.s under the cover of darkness to a hotel more than two hours from where they live, in order to “throw off the scent to the press,” a publicist told me, though “scent” is a strange word choice here because anyone with a nose could have    the place from the sheer concentration of applied Shalimar. But there was good reason for the secrecy. Leaks from these reunion shows have been rampant, and after a previous one, Andy Cohen, the   mediator and the franchise creator (or as he says, “the person who gets credit for creating the franchise” when, really, a lot of other people were involved) realized that the leaks might be coming from the hair and makeup teams, who watch the live feed from a holding room. He told the producers to cut the audio to those dressing rooms. Since then, the integrity of his reunion show  —   if, again, “integrity” is the right word to describe the absolute ravaging of women by their former, current and future friends, accusing one another of everything from having had more than their admitted amount of plastic surgery to being an actual F.
