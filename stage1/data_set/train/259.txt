Photographs recently released by the Australian government show that light   weapons seized from a smuggling vessel near Yemen’s coast appear to have been manufactured in <loc>Iran</loc>, further suggesting that Tehran has had a hand in a   gunrunning operation to the Horn of <loc>Africa</loc> and the Arabian Peninsula. The weapons, a selection of at least nine   grenade launchers, were among thousands of weapons seized by an Australian warship, the Darwin, in February from an Iranian dhow that was sailing under the name Samer. The photographs of the weapons, a sample of the much larger quantity of arms, were obtained by the Small Arms Survey, a   international research center, after a long   dispute with the Australian military.

Matthew Schroeder, an analyst for the survey, said a study of the weapons’ characteristics and factory markings had showed that they match     grenade launchers previously documented in Iraq in 2008 and 2015, and in Ivory Coast in 2014 and 2015. That finding follows a report late last year by Conflict Armament Research, a private arms consultancy, that said the available evidence pointed to an apparent “weapon pipeline, extending from <loc>Iran</loc> to <loc>Somalia</loc> and <loc>Yemen</loc>, which involves the transfer, by dhow, of significant quantities of   weapons and weapons that plausibly derive from Iranian stockpiles. ” For years, Iran has been under a series of international sanctions prohibiting it from exporting arms.
