<loc>WASHINGTON</loc>  —   In the Virginia suburb of McLean, where the local diner is a C. I. A. breakfast hangout, Gen. Michael V. Hayden, who ran the agency for George W. Bush, is playing career counselor these days. With   Donald J. Trump attacking the intelligence community, the general says his “old tribe’’ is feeling “a special angst. ” In   Takoma Park, Md. a “  zone” since 1983, a   resistance movement is taking shape. Nadine Bloch, an activist and artist, is running   training on nonviolent protest  —   complete with mock police officers wielding rolled up newspapers as batons. And here in the District of <loc>Columbia</loc>, where 91 percent of voters cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton, “  panic” is setting in, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and Trump enthusiast. Leslie Harris, a liberal Democratic lawyer, uses war imagery: “I feel like my city is about to be invaded. ” Washington has always been a chameleon of a city, accustomed to remaking itself when the White House changes hands. But as Mr. Trump’s inaugural draws near, in a nation so deeply divided that it seems the political middle has entirely disappeared, perhaps no place in America feels as unsteady and on edge as the capital, which Mr. Trump calls “the swamp. ” With his 6 a. m. Twitter blasts and   style  —   and a roster of conservative Cabinet picks eager to do an   on President Obama’s policies  —   Mr. Trump has upended the city’s rhythms and jangled its nerves. The White House press corps is fighting to keep its work space in the West Wing.   lobbyists worry their clients will turn up in his Twitter feed. Civil servants, many of them working class, say he knows nothing about running a bureaucracy. “We don’t know exactly what to expect from Trump, except that he’s combative,” said Robert Dallek, a presidential biographer, who has lived here for 20 years.
