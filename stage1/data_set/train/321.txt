<loc>WASHINGTON</loc>  —   On Friday, Representative John
Lewis, Democrat of <loc>Georgia</loc>, declared that he did
not view Donald J. Trump as a “legitimate president. ” Mr. Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement, said he planned to boycott the inauguration, the first he will skip in three decades. On Saturday, Mr. Trump hit back. “Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,” Mr. Trump said in a pair of early morning Twitter posts. “All talk, talk, talk  —   no action or results,” he added. “Sad!” While some questioned Mr. Lewis’s assertion, many others expressed indignation about Mr. Trump’s outburst, pointing out the unseemliness of attacking a civil rights leader on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Mr. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders, beaten by police officers while marching from Selma to Montgomery in <loc>Alabama</loc>. Others ridiculed Mr. Trump’s characterization of Mr. Lewis’s district, which is majority   and encompasses   of Atlanta, as “horrible,” “falling apart” and “crime infested. ” In fact, Georgia’s Fifth Congressional District includes parts of wealthy areas like Buckhead the world’s busiest airport,   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Some pointed out that fighting with Mr. Lewis distracted attention from a Senate investigation, announced the day before, that will look at possible contacts between Mr. Trump’s campaign team and <loc>Russia</loc>. In addition, Mr. Trump’s poll numbers have slipped into uncharted depths for an incoming president, with a Gallup poll released on Friday finding that about half of Americans disapprove of Mr. Trump’s transition effort. Mr. Trump’s feud with Mr. Lewis carried echoes of his attacks on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the   parents of an American soldier kill
