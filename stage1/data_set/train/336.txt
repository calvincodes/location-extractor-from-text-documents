<loc>HAVANA</loc>  —   Andrés Iván and his girlfriend grew up in <loc>Cuba</loc> but had long planned their future in the <loc>United States</loc>. She left four months ago to find work and made it to <loc>Miami</loc>, where she was legally welcomed.

He sold his 1956 Pontiac, his   head of cattle and his   house, pulling together about $12, 000.
