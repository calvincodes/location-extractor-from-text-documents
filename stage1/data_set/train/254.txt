<loc>HONG KONG</loc>  —   <loc>Taiwan</loc> scrambled   fighter jets and dispatched a frigate to the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday after <loc>China</loc> sent its sole aircraft carrier into the waterway, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported. The transit of the aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, came amid rising tensions between <loc>Taiwan</loc> and <loc>China</loc> after   Donald J.

Taiwan’s response was the third time in three days that air forces in the region had scrambled jets in response to Chinese military activity, after Japan and South Korea deployed fighters on Monday. Those actions occurred when a squadron of six Chinese bombers and two other aircraft flew over the waters that separate <loc>Japan</loc> and <loc>South Korea</loc> and over the Sea of Japan. <loc>Taiwan</loc>, considered by Beijing to be Chinese territory, has been governed separate
