■ Senator Jeff Sessions of <loc>Alabama</loc> offered assurances that he would be willing as attorney general to tell   Donald J. Trump “no” and not be “a mere rubber stamp. ” ■ He said that waterboarding is “absolutely” illegal and that he did not support barring Muslims from the <loc>United States</loc>. ■ Because of comments he made during the presidential campaign, Mr. Sessions said he would recuse himself from any lingering investigations involving Hillary Clinton’s emails or her family’s foundation. ■ Retired Gen. John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security nominee, said that a wall on the border with <loc>Mexico</loc> would not by itself remedy illegal immigration. Here’s the latest: Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, questioned Mr. Sessions about his links to groups and people who have taken xenophobic views. Here’s a quick primer, from a recent Times profile. Mr. Blumenthal asked: “How can Americans have confidence that you’re going to enforce   laws if you’ve accepted awards from these kinds of groups and associated with these kinds of individuals and won’t return the awards?” Mr. Sessions said he does not necessarily share the views of every political donor or organization he has received an award from. Mr. Sessions came of age in the Justice Department at the height of the crack epidemic. He has described himself as a lieutenant in the war on drugs, said he was “heartbroken” when President Obama compared marijuana to alcohol, and criticized the administration for not enforcing drug laws in states like <loc>Colorado</loc> that have legalized marijuana. He said in 2015: Flash forward to Tuesday. Mr. Sessions sidestepped questions about whether he would put the weight of the Justice Department behind drug prosecution in those states. Doing so would set up a huge fight over states’ rights and federal drug policy. “I know it won’t be an easy decision,” he said.
