<loc>BAGHDAD</loc>  —   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy <loc>Baghdad</loc> market, killing at least 36 people hours after President François Hollande of <loc>France</loc> arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack.
