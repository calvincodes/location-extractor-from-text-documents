United States prosecutors said on Friday that they had charged three executives at <loc>Takata</loc>, the Japanese auto parts maker, with fabricating test data to mask a fatal airbag defect, a striking turn in a case that set off the largest automotive recall in <loc>United States</loc> history. Prosecutors also announced that Takata had agreed to plead guilty to charges of wire fraud for providing the false data, a rare outcome for businesses accused of wrongdoing. The company, based in Tokyo, was also fined $1 billion. The guilty plea and fine had been widely expected, but the charges against the executives intensified a scandal that has roiled regulators, led to congressional hearings and brought the Japanese manufacturer to the brink of bankruptcy. The airbags, which can rupture violently when they deploy, have been linked to at least 11 deaths and more than 180 injuries in <loc>the United States</loc>. “They falsified and manipulated data because they wanted to make profits on their airbags, knowing they were creating risk for the   who are soccer moms like me,” Barbara L. McQuade, a United States attorney for the Eastern District of <loc>Michigan</loc>, said at a news conference in <loc>Detroit</loc>. “The risk they allowed is really reprehensible,” she said. “We want auto suppliers to know they have to put safety ahead of profits. Cheaters will not be allowed to gain a competitive advantage. ” The indictments are the latest moves by the outgoing Obama administration to come down harder on   crime, including guilty pleas from companies and charges against individual managers and executives. Federal prosecutors this week also charged six Volkswagen executives for their roles in an   scandal, and the automaker pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and other crimes. The efforts are seen as a departure from the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when not a single top bank executive went to prison, fueling a public outcry over the perception that Wall Street giants were “too big to jail. ” Tak
