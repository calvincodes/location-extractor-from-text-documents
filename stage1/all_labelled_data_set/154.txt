<loc>WASHINGTON</loc>  —   Russian warplanes have carried out airstrikes to support Turkey’s offensive in northern <loc>Syria</loc> against the Islamic State, an important evolution in a budding   partnership. The deepening ties threaten to marginalize the United States in the struggle to shape Syria’s ultimate fate. The air missions, which took place for about a week near the strategically important town of Al Bab, represent the Kremlin’s first use of its military might to help the Turks in their fight against the militant group. The Russians seized an opening to try to build a military relationship with Turkey, a NATO member, as the United States has sought to keep the emphasis on taking Raqqa, the Islamic State’s   capital. The Russian bombing is a remarkable turnabout from November 2015, when a Turkish   fighter jet shot down a Russian   attack plane that had violated Turkey’s airspace. Russia and Turkey had already been involved in a joint effort to establish a   in <loc>Syria</loc>  —   one that does not involve the United States. At the same time, ties between the United States and Turkey have come under growing strain as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has become increasingly alarmed about the Kurdish forces known as the Y. P. G. The United States has aligned itself with those forces to combat the Islamic State in <loc>Syria</loc>. Some analysts say Russia appears to have arrived at an accommodation in which the Turks are moving to establish a security zone in northern <loc>Syria</loc> to preclude Syrian Kurds from setting up an autonomous region. In return, the Turks appear to be backing off their efforts to unseat President Bashar   of <loc>Syria</loc>, who, with Russian help, is strengthening his hold on the country’s major cities to the south. “The   rapprochement is largely tactical,” said James F. Jeffrey, a former <loc>United States</loc> ambassador to <loc>Turkey</loc>. “<loc>Russia</loc> can live for now with a Turkish enclave in northern <loc>Syria</loc> if it does not threaten the Assad regime.
