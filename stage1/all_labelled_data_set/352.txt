<loc>KANSAS</loc> —   The most important play in football as far as the <loc>Kansas</loc> City Chiefs are concerned is not a long gain on first down or a defensive stop on   . It is the punt, the humble   and anyone who rebuts this point with Dave Toub does so at his own peril. Toub is the team’s   coordinator, the mastermind behind an elite unit, one that has fueled the Chiefs’ rise to A. F. C. contender and also his own candidacy for head coaching openings. But before Toub directed a group that has dominated field position and returned nine kickoffs or punts for touchdowns during his four seasons in <loc>Kansas</loc> City, he was a   novice. His first job in that area came during his first season as an N. F. L. coach  —   in 2001, when his current boss, Andy Reid, hired him as a   assistant to the   coordinator John Harbaugh in <loc>Philadelphia</loc>. Early conversations with Harbaugh, now a Super   coach in Baltimore, inculcated the magnitude of the punt. Toub, who was the Chicago Bears’   coordinator for nine seasons after leaving <loc>Philadelphia</loc>, considers the punt an offensive play, and no other offensive play registers the same consistent impact. It averages more than 40 yards. It flips field position. It determines outcomes. “My philosophy is if you punt well, cover well and play good defense, you’ll be in every game,” Toub said in an interview last week. The Chiefs, who play the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night in the playoffs, applied that philosophy en route to going   their best record since 2003, and winning the A. F. C. West for the first time in six seasons. Toub stresses it to newcomers and stalwarts alike, in meeting rooms and on the practice field, until they, too, understand. Twice in Toub’s four seasons, according to data compiled by Football Outsiders, <loc>Kansas</loc> City has had the best average field position in the N. F. L. “It’s why the best   players are on punt,” said one of them, the rookie defensive back Eric Murray.
