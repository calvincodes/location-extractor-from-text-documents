<loc>NICE</loc>, <loc>France</loc>  —   At times it was hard
 to know who was on trial, the smuggler or the state. The
 defendant, Cédric Herrou, 37, a slightly built olive
 farmer, did not deny that for months he had illegally
 spirited dozens of migrants through the remote mountain
 valley where he lives. He would do it again, he suggested.
 Instead, when asked by a judge, “Why do you do all this?”
 Mr. Herrou turned the tables and questioned the humanity of
  France’s practice of rounding up and turning back Africans
   entering illegally from <loc>Italy</loc> in search of
   work and a better life. It was “ignoble,” he said. “There
    are people dying on the side of the road,” Mr. Herrou
    replied. “It’s not right. There are children who are not
     safe. It is enraging to see children, at 2 in the
     morning, completely dehydrated. “I am a Frenchman,” Mr.
      Herrou declared. The trial, which began on Wednesday,
      is no ordinary one. It has been substantially covered
      by the French news media for its rich symbolism and
      for the way it neatly sums up the ambiguity of
      France’s policy toward the unceasing flow of migrants
      into <loc>Europe</loc> and the quandary they present.
      <loc>France</loc>, foremost among European nations,
      prides itself on enlightened humanitarianism,
      fraternity and solidarity. And yet, perhaps first
      among them, too, it is struggling to reconcile those
      values with the pressing realities of a smaller, more
      globalized world, including fear of terrorism. The
      contradictions are being played out in courtrooms, in
      politics and in farmers’ fields, on the sidewalks of
      <loc>Paris</loc> and in train stations from the
      <loc>Côte d’Azur</loc> to the northern port of
      <loc>Calais</loc>, where the government demolished a
      giant migrant camp in the fall. On the one hand, politicians in this year’s presidential election are competing to see who can take the toughest line on securing France’s borders. Most are promising a crackdown on migrants, with admission reserved for   cases of political persecution.
