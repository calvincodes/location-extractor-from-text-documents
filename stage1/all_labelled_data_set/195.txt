<loc>WASHINGTON</loc>  —   The Obama administration has blacklisted five Russians, including the government’s chief public investigator, who is a close aide to President Vladimir V. Putin, for human rights abuses, laying down a marker for   Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before he takes office with a vow to thaw relations with <loc>Russia</loc>. The sanctions, announced Monday by the Treasury Department, are not related to allegations of Russian hacking during the presidential election, according to a senior administration official. But they carry symbolic weight at a charged moment, as likely the last visible act the <loc>United States</loc> will take against <loc>Russia</loc> before power is transferred in <loc>Washington</loc>. The biggest name added to the list is that of Aleksandr I. Bastrykin, who reports directly to Mr. Putin and has carried out political investigations on his behalf. Mr. Bastrykin, officials said, was complicit in the case of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in detention in murky circumstances in November 2009 and for whom the Magnitsky Act was named. Under that 2012 law, passed by Congress with Democratic and Republican support, the Treasury and Justice Departments must investigate and penalize Russian individuals involved in that case and subsequent   or in other human rights abuses. The Obama administration has now put 44 people on the list. The sanctions announced Monday include a ban on travel to the <loc>United States</loc> and a freezing of any assets held by or transactions with American financial institutions. The White House has enforced the law with varying degrees of enthusiasm, depending on relations between the <loc>United States</loc> and <loc>Russia</loc>. In late 2013, human rights activists said, it delayed releasing the list because it worried that the move  —   coming just before the Winter Olympic Games in <loc>Sochi</loc>, <loc>Russia</loc>  —   would further curdle relations. But the administration’s final list, particularly with the inclusion of Mr. Bastrykin, is considered robust.
