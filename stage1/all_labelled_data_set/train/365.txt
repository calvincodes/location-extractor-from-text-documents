In his successful runs for state senator in <loc>Montana</loc> and then for Congress, Representative Ryan Zinke has promoted his   career in the Navy SEALs as one of his main credentials, going so far as to put the SEALs’ Trident symbol on his campaign bus. While he has portrayed his accomplishments in the Navy in glowing terms, Mr. Zinke, a Republican and   Donald J.

Even if a fitness report  —   essentially a performance evaluation  —   gives top marks in other areas,
