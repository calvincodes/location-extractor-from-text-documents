<loc>KABUL</loc>, <loc>Afghanistan</loc>  —   Approximately 300 <loc>United States</loc> Marines will return this spring to help fight a resurgent Taliban in the southern Afghan province of <loc>Helmand</loc>, the site of a yearslong bloody campaign, American officials in <loc>Afghanistan</loc> said on Saturday. An American military spokesman in <loc>Kabul</loc> said the Marines would replace an Army unit stationed in <loc>Helmand</loc>, and would offer training and advice to members of the Afghan military and the national police. “The Marine rotation is to replace soldiers currently here conducting the train, advise and assist mission,” said Brig. Gen. Charles H. Cleveland, a spokesman for United States forces in <loc>Afghanistan</loc>. “We’re very pleased that the Marines will rotate in, as they have tremendous institutional history in the region. ” The Marines were last in <loc>Helmand</loc>, a hotbed of Taliban fighters and poppy cultivation, in October 2014. Since then, Afghan forces, suffering from leadership woes and plagued by corruption, have struggled to hold territory, with district after district falling to the Taliban. For months now, the insurgents have been at the gates of the provincial capital, <loc>Lashkar Gah</loc>. The Afghan military welcomed the news of the Marines’ return. “We have been asking our foreign counterparts in security meetings to increase the level of their troops in <loc>Helmand</loc> Province to help us on the battlefields,” said Shakil Ahmad, an Afghan Army spokesman. Mr. Ahmad said the security situation in region was rapidly deteriorating. The Taliban appeared unfazed by the news of the Marines’ return. “Our mujahedeen continued their progress in the presence of tens of thousands of Americans and other invading forces,” said Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman. “A few hundred other soldiers won’t become an obstacle on the way of our progress. ” Fewer than 8, 400 American troops are currently in <loc>Afghanistan</loc>, deployed either through NATO to train Afghan forces or as part of a smaller American counterterrorism miss
