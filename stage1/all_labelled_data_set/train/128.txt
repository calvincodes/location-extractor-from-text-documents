<loc>RIO DE JANEIRO</loc>  —   Some of the inmates were beheaded. Others had their hearts torn from their bodies. Gang leaders used the blood of their victims to write a nightmarish message of retribution: “Blood is paid for with blood. ” The harrowing scenes on Friday from the latest prison riot in <loc>Brazil</loc>, in which 31 inmates were killed in the northern state of <loc>Roraima</loc> in the Amazon River Basin, pushed the death toll to 93 in six days of mayhem in penitentiaries around the country. The bloodshed has shocked the country and is emerging as the most pressing crisis facing President Michel Temer, whose beleaguered government was already grappling with graft scandals, a weak economy and simmering anger over austerity measures. “The bloodshed is revealing a war between drug gangs, a failed prison system and a weak government,” said Rafael Alcadipani, a scholar who specializes in public security policies at <loc>Fundação Getúlio Vargas</loc>, a leading Brazilian university. “And now the horror is spreading. ” Prison violence that has spilled out into neighboring communities has been a perennial problem in <loc>Brazil</loc>. In 2006, street fighting between the police and First Capital Command, a   gang, left almost 200 people dead in <loc>São Paulo</loc>, causing chaos in the city of 20 million people. The killings in <loc>Roraima</loc> came just days after 56 men were killed in a massacre at a prison in the city of <loc>Manaus</loc>. In two different riots at prisons this week in the states of <loc>Amazonas</loc> and <loc>Paraíba</loc>, six men were also killed. The violence at the Monte Cristo Agricultural Penitentiary in <loc>Boa Vista</loc>, the capital of <loc>Roraima</loc>, adds to fears about an intensifying war between drug gangs for control of the cocaine trade in the Amazon region in <loc>Brazil</loc>. The latest episode is thought to involve fighting between First Capital Command, commonly known by its Portuguese initials, P. C. C. which has roots in the prisons of <loc>São Paulo</loc> in southeastern <loc>Brazil</loc>, and supporters of Red Command, a drug trafficking organizatio
