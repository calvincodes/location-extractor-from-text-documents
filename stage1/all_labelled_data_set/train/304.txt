Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, for today’s introduction. <loc>LOS ANGELES</loc>  —   And on Thursday, it rained. Again. The arrival of another winter rain here, a wet end to a week that began with heavy snows in the <loc>Sierra Nevada</loc>, has begged a welcome question: Is the drought that punished <loc>California</loc> for six years over?

Still, winter is not even half over. Many years have started off wet and gone completely dry. Climate change has produced higher temperatures, which could melt away the snowpack before summer. And parts of the state remain dry. But after six years of mandatory conservation orders, there seems reason for celebration. “This series of storms has done
