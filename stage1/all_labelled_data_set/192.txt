The morning rush at the Jewish community center in <loc>Columbia</loc>, <loc>S. C.</loc> had subsided when the phone rang on Monday. The caller, an   woman, “in a loud screaming voice kept saying there’s a bomb,” said Barry A. Abels, the center’s executive director. At roughly the same time, a woman dialed the Jewish community center in Rockville, Md. nearly 500 miles away, and said there was a bomb. Not long after, a man called a Jewish organization in <loc>Wilmington</loc>, Del. He, too, warned of a bomb. Similar threats, which turned out to be unfounded, were reported all over the <loc>Eastern United States</loc> on Monday, at as many as 16 Jewish community facilities, one advocacy group estimated. Time and time again, the police responded, buildings were evacuated and, after tense waits, the centers and schools reopened. Federal law enforcement officials did not definitively link the threats, but the episodes rattled nerves, and raised deep concern and little doubt that the phone calls had been orchestrated. “My personal take is it’s a statement of where we are in this country,” said Michael Feinstein, the chief executive of the Bender Jewish Community Center of <loc>Washington</loc>, in <loc>Rockville</loc>. “There’s some thought amongst some people that hate speech and hate crimes are O. K. and   is O. K. and I think that is reflective of sort of the political discourse that we’ve had in this country. ” Mr. Feinstein said about 300 people had been in the <loc>Rockville</loc> center when the threat was made, including about 200 preschoolers. After the threat in Delaware, parents were called to pick up preschool and day school students. In <loc>South Carolina</loc>, Mr. Abels said staff members and patrons attending exercise classes had to leave. About three hours later, he said, the authorities said it was safe to return, leaving many to wonder what had happened. “It could be anything from hate groups to a terrorist situation,” Mr. Abels said.
