HOW THE <loc>AMERICA</loc> LOST ITS SECRETSEdward Snowden, the Man and the TheftBy Edward Jay EpsteinIllustrated. 350 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27. 95. People who reveal secrets are either heroes or betrayers, depending on what the secrets are and on the inclinations of the audience for them. In the case of Edward Snowden, who took and then released a great deal of internal data from the National Security Agency in 2013, his admirers have campaigned for a   pardon by President Obama, but Donald Trump has mused that execution might be more appropriate. Journalism based on Snowden’s revelations won the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 2014, and the Oscar for best documentary in 2015 on the other hand, many American government officials think Snowden, who lives in <loc>Russia</loc>, should be brought home and prosecuted for revealing classified information. In 2014, Edward Jay Epstein, the veteran writer on espionage, published a provocative article in The Wall Street Journal proposing another way of looking at Snowden: as a spy. Epstein wrote that an unnamed “former member of President Obama’s cabinet” had told him “that there are only three possible explanations for the Snowden heist: 1) It was a Russian espionage operation 2) It was a Chinese espionage operation 3) It was a joint   operation. ” Now Epstein has produced a long, detailed book elaborating on his theory. Snowden is known for having revealed that the N. S. A. was illegally spying on American citizens, but Epstein says that he actually took almost a million documents that had nothing to do with that, which he didn’t give to journalists. What happened to them? How did a relatively lowly nonemployee at the agency, without much official access, manage to get all that material in the first place? Why did he choose to announce himself to the world from Hong Kong, and why has he remained in <loc>Moscow</loc> since he left <loc>Hong Kong</loc>? You can see the outlines of a coherent hypothesis in “How the <loc>America</loc> Lost Its Secrets.
