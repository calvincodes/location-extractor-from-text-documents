It was 2005, and Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant, was back in <loc>Moscow</loc> pursuing an ambitious plan to build a Trump tower on the site of an old pencil factory along the Moscow River that would offer hotel rooms, condominiums and commercial office space. Letters of intent had been signed and square footage was being analyzed. “There was an opportunity to explore building Trump towers internationally,” said Mr. Sater, who worked for a New   development company that was a partner with Donald J. Trump on a variety of deals during that decade. “And <loc>Russia</loc> was one of those countries. ” The  ’s favorable comments about President Vladimir V. Putin of <loc>Russia</loc> and the conclusion of United States intelligence officials that Moscow acted to help Mr. Trump’s campaign have focused attention on Mr. Trump’s business interests in Russia. Asked about the issue at his news conference last week, Mr. Trump was emphatic on one point: “I have no dealings with <loc>Russia</loc>. ” And he repeated, “I have no deals that could happen in <loc>Russia</loc> because we’ve stayed away. ” The project on the old pencil factory site ultimately fizzled. And by the time Mr. Trump entered the presidential race, he had failed to get any real estate development off the ground in <loc>Russia</loc>. But it was not for lack of trying. Mr. Trump repeatedly sought business in <loc>Russia</loc> as far back as 1987, when he traveled there to explore building a hotel. He applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996. And his children and associates have appeared in <loc>Moscow</loc> over and over in search of joint ventures, meeting with developers and government officials. During a trip in 2006, Mr. Sater and two of Mr. Trump’s children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, stayed at the historic Hotel National Moscow opposite the Kremlin, connecting with potential partners over the course of several days. As recently as 2013, Mr. Trump himself was in <loc>Moscow</loc>.
