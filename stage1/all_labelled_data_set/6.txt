<loc>BEIJING</loc>  —   President Tsai   of <loc>Taiwan</loc> sharply criticized China’s leaders on Saturday, saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island. “Step by step, <loc>Beijing</loc> is going back to the old path of dividing, coercing and even threatening and intimidating <loc>Taiwan</loc>,” she told journalists in <loc>Taipei</loc>, the capital, at a   news conference. Tensions between <loc>Taiwan</loc> and <loc>China</loc>, which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American   Donald J. Trump, breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice. In recent weeks, <loc>China</loc> has stepped up military activities near <loc>Taiwan</loc>, sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday, <loc>Beijing</loc> announced that São Tomé and Príncipe, an island nation off the west coast of <loc>Africa</loc> that was one of Taiwan’s fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies, had switched its allegiance to the mainland, provoking an outcry in <loc>Taiwan</loc>. Despite Beijing’s recent actions, which she said had “hurt the feelings” of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation. “We will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,” she said. Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with <loc>Beijing</loc> while also sending a message that <loc>Taiwan</loc> will exercise restraint. The <loc>United States</loc>, which sees <loc>Taiwan</loc> as one of its most reliable allies in <loc>Asia</loc> and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides. But the election of Mr. Trump could complicate matters. He has antagonized <loc>Beijing</loc> with a series of critical comments. The   has also questioned the One <loc>China</loc> policy, which has underpinned relations between <loc>Washington</loc> and <loc>Beijing</loc> for decades, and criticized China’s military buildup in the disputed South China Sea
