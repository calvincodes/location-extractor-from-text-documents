After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The <loc>South Bronx</loc>, just across the Harlem River from <loc>Manhattan</loc> and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of <loc><loc>New York</loc> City</loc>. And yet the city’s efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal.

In   lobbies and   family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain th
