President Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentence of a man convicted for his role in a Puerto Rican nationalist group linked to more than 100 bombings in <loc>New York</loc> and other cities in the 1970s and 1980s. The man, Oscar Lopez Rivera, was serving a   sentence after being convicted of numerous charges, including seditious conspiracy, a charge used for those plotting to overthrow the United States government. He was linked to the radical group known as the F. A. L. N. the Spanish acronym for the Armed Forces of National Liberation, and was one of more than a dozen group members convicted in the 1980s. Under Mr. Obama’s commutation order, Mr. Lopez Rivera’s prison sentence will expire May 17. It was one of 209 grants of commutation by the president announced Tuesday. The F. A. L. N. which waged a violent campaign for the independence of Puerto Rico, was considered by the authorities to be among the most elusive and resilient terrorist groups to operate in the <loc>United States</loc>. Among its notable attacks was a bombing at Fraunces Tavern in <loc>New York</loc> in 1975 that killed four people. The group was known for its   membership, fanatical zeal and    tactics, as exemplified by the bombings of four government buildings in <loc>Manhattan</loc> and <loc>Brooklyn</loc> on New Year’s Eve in 1982 that seriously wounded three police officers. Mr. Lopez Rivera was not specifically charged in the Fraunces Tavern bombing but more broadly with, among other things, the interstate transportation of firearms with the intent to commit violent crimes, and transportation of explosives with intent to kill and injure people and to destroy government buildings and property. President Bill Clinton offered Mr. Lopez Rivera and other members of the F. A. L. N. clemency in 1999, a decision that stirred an emotional debate. Mr. Clinton said their sentences were out of proportion with their offenses.
