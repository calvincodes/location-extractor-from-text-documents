Mel Craig’s    father has been tormented over the past year
by swindlers calling him at home, threatening him if he did
not send them more money. “Returned after a   trip to find
receipts on the table for $300 worth of iTunes cards,” wrote
 Ms. Craig, a New York Times commenter in
 <loc>Washington</loc>, <loc>D. C</loc>. “Dad doesn’t even
 know what iTunes is. ” More than 1, 000 readers responded
 to Ellen Barry’s recent article on a call center in
 <loc>India</loc> that is being investigated for fraud
 against Americans. Many of the commenters, who responded on
  the article and on The Times’s Facebook post, said they,
  too, had received calls from strangers demanding payments
  or personal information. Some expressed sympathy for those
   who are conned, and others voiced anger at the criminals
   and a system that seems to do little to protect the
   vulnerable. Readers also shared their tactics for dealing
    with the calls. “Sometimes I give the scammer a made up
    credit card number one digit short of the full
    complement, then keep changing the sequence when they
    read it back,” Bruce in <loc>Cleveland</loc> wrote. “I
    can still make dinner while I’m doing this on speaker
    phone. ” Here is a selection of the responses. They have
